        <h3>Informative Bio</h3>
        <p>This is my portfolio website where you will find out some of my
            capabilities as a new Web Developer. On this page I will have links 
            to a few of my projects along with my contact information. I am based out 
            of the New York and New Jersey area with a passion for sports, art, music, and
            entrepreneurship. I would greatly appreciate you reaching out and giving some feedback
            on what you think of some of my work. Hope you enjoy viewing as much as I liked creating it!</p>

    <p>
        The projects to the left of the page represent great visuals of some of the things I cherish in my life.
        Those things would be the beauty of New York City, love for the game of basketall (specifically the Los Angeles Lakers),
        being a father, and last but not least loving what I do.
